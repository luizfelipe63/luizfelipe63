I’m a full stack developer that loves everything about coding. I currently work as a ReactJs instructor at Rocketseat (Formerly also Node.JS and React Native instructor).

- 🐶 I like to identify myself as a Shiba Inu.
- ⚡ I was invited to be a mentor at the biggest Hackaton in Latin America, mentoring dozens of developers during the RS/XP 2019.
- 👨🏻‍💻 I taught or helped dozens of thousands of developers under the tecnologies I work daily with, such as ReactJS, NextJS, Styled-Components, Stitches, and so many more.
